Smart Attendance Management System with QR Code & Location Verification ✅

🚀 Project Overview
➤ Welcome to the Smart Attendance Management System — a modern, efficient way to automate attendance taking using QR codes and geolocation verification. This project eliminates the hassle of manual attendance while preventing proxy attendance through real-time location checks.
➤ Imagine a classroom where the teacher generates a unique QR code linked to the student list and location. Students simply scan the QR code on their phones, select their names, and mark attendance—all while the system verifies they are physically present within the permitted area. Easy, secure, and smart!

💡 Key Features
✦ QR Code Generation: Teachers upload the student list (CSV) and specify a geolocation with a radius. The system generates a unique QR code linking to the attendance session.

✦ Real-Time Geolocation Verification: When students mark attendance, their current location is captured and verified to ensure they are within the allowed radius.

✦ Duplicate Attendance Prevention: The system blocks multiple attendance markings from the same student for the same session.

✦ Attendance Download: Teachers can download attendance records as CSV files for easy record-keeping.

✦ Cross-Device Compatibility: Works seamlessly on desktops, laptops, and mobile devices—no extra app installation required.

✦ User-Friendly Interface: Clean, intuitive frontend designed using HTML5 and CSS for smooth user experience.

➤ Data Handling          	pandas	                        CSV file reading and attendance data management
➤ Location API	          Browser                         Geolocation API	Capturing real-time GPS coordinates from users

⚙️ How It Works
1. Teacher Uploads Student List: Upload a CSV file containing student roll numbers and names.

2. Set Location & Radius: Enter the latitude, longitude, and permissible radius (in meters) where attendance marking is allowed.

3. Generate QR Code: The system creates a unique QR code embedding the attendance session URL.

4. Students Scan & Mark Attendance:

   ◉ Students scan the QR code using their mobile device.

   ◉ They select their name and roll number from the displayed list.

   ◉ The system requests location permission and verifies their GPS coordinates.

   ◉ If within the defined radius, attendance is marked and timestamped.

5.Teacher Downloads Attendance: After the session, the teacher downloads the attendance sheet in CSV format.

🎯 Future Improvements
🔸 Add authentication for teachers and students.

🔸 Integrate with school databases for automatic student list sync.

🔸 Enhance location verification using Wi-Fi or Bluetooth beacons.

🔸 Build a mobile app version for even smoother attendance marking.

🔸 Add analytics and reporting dashboard for attendance trends.
